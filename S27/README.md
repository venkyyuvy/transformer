- You need to fine-tune this Links to an external site. model. It's new, so you'll have to make some changes (including sequence length)!
- You need to use QLoRA strategy as described above
- Once done, upload to Hugging Face Spaces, and share the link for your huggingface app, where I can query your model and see the result!
- Share with the world!
